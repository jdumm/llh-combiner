# To take a single set of trials (results.txt) and split it into two parts (for testing), do the following:

awk 'NR % 2==1 {print}' results.txt  > results1.txt
awk 'NR % 2==0 {print}' results.txt  > results2.txt

Then simply copy the header of results.txt into results2.txt.  Now you have two independent data sets.


gzip'ing these text files gives a reduction in file size by about a factor of 5.
