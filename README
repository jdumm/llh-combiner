A project for merging independent 1D maximum likelihood analyses to find a joint maximum likelihood.  Also calculates Neyman (strict) or Feldman&Cousins upper limits and sensitivities.  

So far, there is a script for merging simulated log-likelihood curves from independent analyses as well as a simple Neyman sensitivity script. TODO: Implement F&C limit calculation (possibly starting from a script by Martin) and some more data visualization features for the sensitivity calculation to verify the TS distributions.

Note that if running with ipython, the args can properly be passed to a script like merge.py by using an extra "--" between args, e.g.:
ipython merge.py -- test_data/results1.txt test_data/results2.txt --interp --diagnostic
